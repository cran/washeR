Title: Time Series Outlier Detection
Version: 0.1.3
Author: Andrea Venturini
Maintainer: Andrea Venturini <andrea.venturini@bancaditalia.it>
Description: Time series outlier detection with non parametric test. This is a new outlier detection methodology (washer): efficient for time saving elaboration and implementation procedures, adaptable for general assumptions and for needing very short time series, reliable and effective as involving robust non parametric test. You can find two approaches: single time series (a vector) and grouped time series (a data frame).
